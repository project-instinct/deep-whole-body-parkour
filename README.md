# Deep Whole-body Parkour

This is the repository that contains source code for the [Deep Whole-body Parkour website](https://project-instinct.github.io/deep-whole-body-parkour/).

Deep Whole-body Parkour presents research on neural whole-body control for dynamic parkour behaviors in legged robots. This work develops learning-based approaches for enabling robots to perform complex, acrobatic maneuvers that require coordinated control of the entire body.

## Key Contributions

- **Neural Whole-body Control**: End-to-end learning of policies for whole-body coordination during dynamic tasks
- **Parkour Skill Learning**: Training robots to perform complex parkour maneuvers through deep reinforcement learning
- **Real-world Deployment**: Transfer of learned skills to physical robotic platforms

## Related Research

This work is part of the broader [Project Instinct](https://project-instinct.github.io/) initiative exploring instinct-level intelligences for robotics.
